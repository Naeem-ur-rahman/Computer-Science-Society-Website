Title: Responsive Website for Computer Science Society

Description:

As a passionate web developer, I recently completed a project that holds a special place in my heart - building a responsive website for my university's Computer Science Society. The website serves as an introduction to the society, showcasing its activities and upcoming events.

Using my expertise in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I crafted a responsive design that ensures seamless user experience across various devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. I intentionally avoided using any frameworks to challenge myself and hone my coding skills.

The website features a captivating home page that greets visitors with an eye-catching layout and engaging content, providing insights into the society's mission and vision. The event page showcases upcoming events, activities, and news related to the society, creating a dynamic and interactive experience for users.

To ensure accessibility for all users, I followed best practices for clean and organized coding, optimized the website for performance, and paid attention to usability and user experience. The project allowed me to apply my technical skills in web development while also focusing on creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional website.
